8. Given a normal binary tree, write a function to serialize the

9. Decode ways on leetcode

11. Convert a binary tree into a circular doubly linked list. The order 
    of the elements in the linked list have to be the order of elements 
    you get when you do an in order traversal of the binary tree.
12. Interval

14. Process - DEPENDANT PROCESSES
    0 - 2,3
    1 - 2
    2 - nill
    3 - nill

    above data is given in map. You need to return 3,2,0,1 or 2,3,0,1 or 
    3,2,1,0 or 2,3,1,0. Since the answer is straight forward he asked me 
    to code that using theads. Finally he changed the input to
    0-2,3
    1-3,2
    2-nill
    3-nill

    Now how would you change your code?
